											<h3>Effective Assessment Across Multiple Age Groups</h3>
											<p>I have experience planning assessments for both Junior and Senior High School age groups. I work hard to ensure that my assessments build student confidence. I spend a great deal of time to ensure that my assessments are fun, engaging, and meaningful.</p>
											<p>Below are example assessments I have utilized in my teaching, including those mentioned in my assessment philosophy.</p>

											<h3>Assessment Philosophy</h3>
											<p>My philosophy for assessment is rooted in my core belief that one of our first priorities as
educators is to ensure our students have the knowledge, skills, and attitudes to be prosperous and
functional citizens in society. I work to successfully integrate modern theoretical pedagogical
practices into my teaching, within the confines of practical application. I believe that first and
foremost, our student’s need to build confidence in their abilities while also accepting their
shortcomings. The students need to build this confidence from within, with myself merely
serving as their guide. As Parkay describes, “In a progressively oriented classroom, the teacher
serves as a guide or resource person whose primary responsibility is to facilitate student
learning” (2009)</p>
<p>To that end, I construct my assessments using scaffolding, as I believe in building a
foundation of knowledge, and then developing off of that foundation. For practical reasons,
having a vocabulary assignment feed into a newspaper article assignment works well to keep
both the students and myself organized. I believe scaffolding is pivotal to assessment; as stated
by Maybin, Mercer and Stierer (1992), scaffolding “is a term which helps to portray the
temporary, but essential nature of the mentor’s assistance as the learner advances in knowledge
and understanding”. In terms of my assessment philosophy, this demonstrates to the student’s
that everyone needs to walk, before they can run. This line of thinking is further evident in the
manner in which I assess my students overtime: relative to themselves. I prefer to assess each
student based on their own individual merits, and reward slow and steady progress. Students
should be rewarded for their successive approximations and improving themselves.</p>
<p>I believe in the benefits of positive reinforcement over negative reinforcement. As
posited by Dr. Richard Lavoie, positive reinforcement changes behaviour for the better, whereas
negative reinforcement simply eliminates a specific behaviour without addressing the underlying
cause (Lavoie, 1997). As such, I employ positive reinforcement when I assess my students. This
allows me to mold their bad habits into effective learning strategies. Furthermore, not only does
positive reinforcement benefit behaviour, it also allows me to continue to foster a positive
relationship with my students.</p>
<p>To put what I have discussed into perspective, I will cite the assessments I designed for
use in teaching Global History 12 in Nova Scotia. The unit in question was on Justice, with a
specific focus on the Israel-Palestine conflict. To start the students off, I gave them a vocabulary
assignment with key terms for the unit. Their task was to fill in a 3 column chart: the first column
was to be filled in with what they thought was the definition of the word, with marks earned
regardless of the accuracy of the provided definitions. The second column was to be filled in
with a sentence containing the word. The third column was to be left blank - we would use it to
fill in the actual definitions of the terms throughout the unit. This allowed me to assess the class’s
overall prior knowledge on the subject while rewarding a good effort, regardless of skill level.
This begins the process of scaffolding and building the students’ confidence.</p>
<p>The second assignment was an op-ed article on the aforementioned Israel/Palestine crisis.
For this article, they had to use a minimum of 5 terms from the previous vocabulary assignment.
This allows the students to continue building their confidence, as the students now have a diverse
vocabulary related to the topic in a dictionary format from their first assignment. This gets the
students to look at that vocabulary assignment again, allowing another chance for those words to
commit to their long-term memories. This would lead into the third assessment for the unit: the
unit test. The unit test would contain questions on vocabulary at the very beginning; since the
students have already studied these definitions multiple times through the completion of their
prior assessments, this would build their confidence for the remainder of the test. This remainder
would consist of short answer questions on topics that they would have employed in their op-ed
article assignment; since the foundation of knowledge is already there, the students can
confidently complete the test. But most importantly, they actually learned along the way.</p>
<p>Despite what is written above, I don’t frequently employ testing as a method of
assessment. Instead, I like to provide students with multiple avenues to demonstrate their
learning, so that they can do so in the manner they feel strongest in. My summative assessments
take into account different strengths students may possess, and as such contain multiple avenues
for completion. For example, students could write an essay, film a mock news cast, record a
mock radio show, and other methods of assessment that allow students to play to their strengths
while also providing me with the content necessary for evaluation.</p>
<p>I believe all students have the potential to be outstanding, and that this is a necessary
achievement in order for the most rapid possible societal progress. In order to foster this, I enter
the role of both coach and cheerleader, ensuring they’re rightfully proud of the work they’re
doing, while also forcing them to strive to be better. Using scaffolding, I act as their guide to
build their confidence, thus fostering good citizens ready to thrive within society.</p>
