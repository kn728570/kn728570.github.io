									<h3>Teaching Philosophy</h3>
									<p>My teaching philosophy is built on the foundation of my personal sense of morality; I consider myself an altruist, 
									and I truly believe that every person has the right to happiness and fulfillment. Based on this notion, it is my opinion 
									that each and every person simultaneously holds the responsibility to assist (or at the very least, not impede) others in 
									their own pursuit of contentment. With that being said, this world can be a harsh and cruel place, and can seem especially 
									daunting to those about to enter society. As an altruist, I aspire to accomplish two goals: to assist my fellow human beings 
									on their path to self-actualization in the face of a society that is often unforgiving, and to contribute my efforts to the 
									improvement of that society in order to provide a better environment for others to achieve happiness. It is this personal design 
									that drove me to become an educator, as it allows me to accomplish both goals simultaneously. As a teacher, I can devote my career 
									to assisting the next generation on their journey to self-actualization, while also creating graduating classes full of empathetic, 
									socially conscious citizens ready to improve the world along with me (in spirit). To this end, I would consider my teaching 
									philosophy to be firmly entrenched in the ideals of progressivism.</p> 

									<p>The foundational principles that underpin our contemporary understanding of progressivism were first popularized by educational
									reformer John Dewey, who posits that education should be centered on those being educated, as opposed to previous conservative ideology
									that emphasized the educator. To this end, I believe all students have distinctive strengths and merits that require individualized methods
									of teaching in order for them to be nurtured to their full potential. Dewey believed that education was a vehicle for social change, stating,
									“the adjustment of individual activity on the basis of this social consciousness is the only sure method of social reconstruction.” (Dewey, 1898).</p> 

									<p>In order for each individual student to thrive, the classroom must be an environment in which the students feel safe, secure, happy, and welcome. 
									To this end, I instill my philosophy of altruism into the students so that each of them can support one another. This requires a reconstruction of 
									previous attitudes the student may have held for one another. To this end, I employ a great deal of collaborative activities to foster an inclusive 
									community. The students must understand the similarities and differences among their experiences in order to be able to empathize with one another. 
									Not only does this create an environment in which each individual feels comfortable at embracing and developing their strengths, it fosters an 
									indelible sense of compassion for their fellow human being that will persist beyond the confines of the school,  benefiting our society in the long term.</p> 

									<p>Given that I believe each student has individual strengths, I employ differentiated instruction into my teaching so that each student has an opportunity 
									to demonstrate their capabilities. I incorporate direct instruction for those who need it, while providing guided notes and visual aid to those who 
									learn differently. I provide multiple avenues for completing an assessment so that the students can select one that best highlights their skills. 
									However, it is just as imperative that students also work on addressing their weaknesses, if possible. As such, I provide incentive to those who choose
									a method of assessment that falls out of their typical scope. This, in conjunction with the development of a positive environment in which students are 
									unafraid to make mistakes, encourages students to improve upon their less-refined skills.</p>

									<p>To conclude, my teaching progressivist teaching philosophy is firmly rooted on my personal philosophy of altruism. As such, I feel it is my responsibility
									to ensure that each student is on the path to achieving self-actualization. In this regard, I work on a student by student basis to best provide the 
									individualized guidance they require, both inside and outside the curriculum. Furthermore, I foster a sense of empathy and compassion within them, so 
									that they can support and guide each other alongside me, and into the future when they are no longer under my care. This translates to classrooms full 
									of students entering society with a kinder disposition; with my efforts and the efforts of teachers like me, we can cultivate a generation that can 
									institute tangible positive social change.</p>

									<h3>Building Relationships</h3>
									<p>paragraph on building relationships goes here</p>
									<h3>Inclusive Practices</h3>
									<p>Being an inclusive educator is a core part of my pedagogical beliefs. I believe that our classrooms
									need to be fun place for our students to learn. However, this requires us to take special measures to ensure
									that the classroom is fun for all of the students. This is what inclusive education means to me; doing whatever is
									needed to be done to ensure my students are having fun. This can mean adaptations for students who have issues,
									special consideration at including culturally relevant material in my lessons, broadening my assessment methods
									so that students can demonstrate their learning by choosing a method that suits them best, and much more. My thoughts on this matter are further
									explored in <a href="PDF/sociologyresponse.pdf" target="blank">my writing on the BIPOC experience.</a></p>
									<p>Being an inclusive educator often times doesn't require a lot of effort. Often, it can just mean
									being cognizant of students and their differences. For example, during my first practicum at J.L. Ilsley High
									School, I had a few Syrian refugee students who were still learning English. As a parting gift to all the students,
									I had copies of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms made for the Students. I had special copies of the Charter
									printed in Arabic for my Syrian students, while also providing them with the English copies that everyone else received.
									The students were extremely grateful that I had taken the time to provide them with copies in their native language.
									All this took was downloading an additional PDF of the Charter of the Government of Canada's website, and attaching that 
									PDF with the English copy. Being Inclusive can simply mean being proactive and mindful, something I pride myself in.</p>
